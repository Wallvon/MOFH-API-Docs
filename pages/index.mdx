# Introduction

Welcome to the MyOwnFreeHost (MOFH) API Documentation. This documentation is unofficial and provided by [Robert S](https://robert-s.dev) and [contributors](https://github.com/Wallvon/MOFH-API-Docs/graphs/contributors).

If you find any errors throughout this API reference or know of any API endpoints or wrappers that aren't listed, please make an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wallvon/MOFH-API-Docs/issues/new) or join the [iFastNet Community Discord server](https://dsc.gg/ifastnet) and ping `Roberto#1762`.

There are examples in cURL and Python, but if you know any other programming language and are willing to contribute please consider making a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Wallvon/MOFH-API-Docs).

MOFH API wrappers:

* [mofh-client](https://github.com/InfinityFreeHosting/mofh-client) (PHP)

* [mofh](https://github.com/Wallvon/mofh) (Python)

* [mofh-client-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mofh-client-js) (JS)

**Side-notes**
- You can create up to **3** accounts per person with the MOFH API. You _may_ be able to create more accounts, but this is not advised and when I asked the iFastNet team they said that there was a limit of 3 accounts per person.
- The MOFH API is pretty limited, so you can't really do more than what is listed here without doing some trickery and whatnot.
- The SSL certificate on `https://panel.myownfreehost.net/xml-api/` tends to expire, so you may need to turn off SSL verification.
- You can use both `https://panel.myownfreehost.net/xml-api/` and `https://panel.myownfreehost.net:2087/xml-api/` to access the API, but on the latter the SSL certificate is practically guaranteed to be expired.
- **Every** request returns a 200 OK status code, even invalid requests. You need to check the response body to see if the request was successful or not.

With that out of the way, let's get started, shall we?
