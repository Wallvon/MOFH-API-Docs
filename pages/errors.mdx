# Errors

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    The MyOwnFreeHost API doesn't use any error codes, and will <u>**always**</u> return a 200 HTTP code. This is less than ideal, but it is what it is.
</Callout>

## Ticket Creation

Check the returned string to see if it contains `SUCCESS :`. If it does, the ticket creation was successful, if it does not, the request failed and the string contains the error message.

## Ticket Reply

Check to see if the returned string is exactly `SUCCESS` (Be sure to use PHP's `trim()`, Python's `.strip()`, etc first). If the string is not exactly "SUCCESS", the request failed and the string contains the error.

## "Information" Endpoints

No good way to detect errors, you probably don't ever need to run these on production / live environment anyways.

## "Accounts" Endpoints

Take a look inside `"result" -> "status"` (for JSON API) or the `<status>` tag (XML API). Run `trim()`/`.strip()`/etc, then check if the result is `1`(Don't use strict comparison, or cast to `int` first). If status is not 1, the error can (usually) be found in `"result" -> "statusmsg"` (JSON) or `<statusmsg>` (XML).

## "Domains" Endpoints

These are all different, see the endpoint's page for additional information on what each one returns.
