# Errors

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    The MyOwnFreeHost API doesn't use any error codes, and will <u>**always**</u> return a 200 HTTP code. This is less than ideal, but it is what it is.

## Ticket Creation

The best way to check for errors when creating tickets is checking the return string to see if it contains `SUCCESS :`. If it does, the creation was successful, if it does not, the reason failed and the string contains the error message.

## Ticket Reply

Similar to ticket creation, check to see if the return string is exactly `SUCCESS` (Be sure to use PHP's `trim()`, Python's `.strip()`, etc). If the string is not exactly "SUCCESS", the request failed and the string contains the error.

## "Information" Endpoints

No good way to detect errors, you probably don't ever need to run these on production / live environment anyways.

## "Accounts" Endpoints

Take a look inside `"result" -> "status"` (for JSON API) or the `<status>` tag (XML API). Runs `trim()`, `.strip(), then check if the result is `1`(Don't use strict comparison, or cast to `int` first). If status is not 1, the error can (usually) be found in `"result" -> "statusmsg"` / `<statusmsg>`.

## "Domains" Endpoints

These are all different, see the endpoint's page for additional information on what each one returns
