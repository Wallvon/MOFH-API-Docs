# Errors

    The MyOwnFreeHost API doesn't use any error codes, and will <u>**always**</u> return a 200 HTTP code. This is less than ideal, but it is what it is.

To do proper error handling, you would have to get the text inside the `<status></status>` tags to get the status of your request (either `0` or `1`). Or, if you use the `getuserdomains.php` and `getdomainuser.php` endpoints, you will see that it just returns `null` instead of the list/array it usually gives.
